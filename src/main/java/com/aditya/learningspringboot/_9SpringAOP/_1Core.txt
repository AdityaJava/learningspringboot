 * SPRING AOP – BASIC CONCEPT
 *
 * AOP = Aspect Oriented Programming
 * Purpose:
 *  - Separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, transactions
 *  - Keep business logic clean
 *
 * Core terms:
 *  - Aspect     : A class containing pointcuts + advice
 *  - JoinPoint  : A point during execution (method execution in Spring AOP)
 *  - Pointcut   : Expression that selects which methods to intercept
 *  - Advice     : Action taken at the join point (@Before, @After, @Around)
