# LOCKING BEHAVIOR AT EACH ISOLATION LEVEL
# (Crystal clear, simple words)

====================================================================
1) READ_UNCOMMITTED
====================================================================
READ:
- No shared locks
- Can read uncommitted changes of other transactions

WRITE:
- Writes take exclusive lock until commit

Meaning:
👉 Reads never lock anything.
👉 Can see dirty/uncommitted data.

====================================================================
2) READ_COMMITTED
====================================================================
READ:
- Takes shared lock during SELECT
- Releases shared lock immediately after read. That is it doesn't wait for commit or rollback

WRITE:
- Exclusive lock held until commit

Meaning:
👉 You always see committed data.
👉 But if you read same row twice, value may change.

====================================================================
3) REPEATABLE_READ
====================================================================
READ:
- Takes shared lock and **keeps it for entire transaction**
- Prevents other transactions from updating the rows you read

WRITE:
- Exclusive lock until commit

(MySQL only)
- Uses "next-key locks" = row lock + gap lock

Meaning:
👉 If you read a row, nobody can change it until your txn ends.
👉 In MySQL, also prevents phantom rows using gap locks.

====================================================================
4) SERIALIZABLE
====================================================================
READ:
- Takes range locks / predicate locks
- Prevents inserts/deletes in the range you query

WRITE:
- Exclusive lock until commit

Meaning:
👉 Highest safety.
👉 Makes transactions run as if one-by-one.

# THE CLEANEST POSSIBLE SUMMARY TABLE
====================================================================

| Isolation Level    | Shared Lock | Shared Lock Duration | Prevents Updates to Read Rows? | Prevents New Rows Appearing? |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| READ_UNCOMMITTED   | ❌ No       | N/A                   | ❌ No                            | ❌ No                         |
| READ_COMMITTED     | ✔ Yes       | Only during read      | ❌ No                            | ❌ No                         |
| REPEATABLE_READ    | ✔ Yes       | Full transaction      | ✔ Yes                           | MySQL ✔, Postgres ❌          |
| SERIALIZABLE       | ✔ Yes       | Full transaction + range | ✔ Yes                       | ✔ Yes                        |

====================================================================
# 1-LINE MEMORY HACK (Correct & Clear)
====================================================================
READ_UNCOMMITTED → Reads don’t lock
READ_COMMITTED   → Reads lock briefly
REPEATABLE_READ  → Reads lock until commit
SERIALIZABLE     → Locks rows + ranges
