1. It tells, how the changes made by one transaction are visible to other transactions running in parallel


Isolation Levels in Spring
==========================

1. Isolation.DEFAULT
--------------------
- Use the database's default isolation level.
- Usually READ_COMMITTED in most DBs.
- Recommended unless you need special consistency.

2. Isolation.READ_UNCOMMITTED
------------------------------
- Lowest isolation level.
- Allows:
    * Dirty Reads      (read uncommitted data)
    * Non-repeatable Reads
    * Phantom Reads
- Faster but unsafe.

3. Isolation.READ_COMMITTED
---------------------------
- Prevents Dirty Reads.
- Allows:
    * Non-repeatable Reads
    * Phantom Reads
- Most commonly used level.
- Good balance of consistency + performance.

4. Isolation.REPEATABLE_READ
-----------------------------
- Prevents:
    * Dirty Reads
    * Non-repeatable Reads
- Allows:
    * Phantom Reads (in some DBs)
- Ensures the same row read twice gives the same value.
- Useful in financial transactions.

5. Isolation.SERIALIZABLE
-------------------------
- Highest isolation level.
- Prevents:
    * Dirty Reads
    * Non-repeatable Reads
    * Phantom Reads
- Full consistency.
- Most expensive (locks entire range/table).
- Very slow; avoid unless absolutely needed.

Common Real-world Recommendations
---------------------------------
- Use DEFAULT (or READ_COMMITTED) for most web apps.
- Use REPEATABLE_READ for critical transactions like:
      * transfer money
      * inventory locking
- Avoid READ_UNCOMMITTED (unsafe).
- Avoid SERIALIZABLE unless your system requires strict correctness.

Quick Summary Table
-------------------
Level              DirtyRead   Non-repeatable   Phantom
---------------------------------------------------
READ_UNCOMMITTED    YES          YES          YES
READ_COMMITTED      NO           YES          YES
REPEATABLE_READ     NO           NO           YES*
SERIALIZABLE        NO           NO           NO
(* depends on DB)

Concurrency is high at READ_UNCOMMITTED and decreases from it to SERIALIZABLE
. That means more threads can run in parallel when concurrency is high
