public class User{

    public void updateUser(){
        //1. Update DB
        //2. External API call
        //3. update DB
    }
}

1. @Transactional will cause an issue here because external call is involved which will take sometime
2. So now we are holding a DB connection for that much time. And suppose at the time of peak traffic where we have to open a large number
   of DB connections this API call will be an bottleneck and this will choke our system in peak hours
3. In this case programmatic can help us
