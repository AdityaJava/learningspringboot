Use @Component when:
- The class is part of your project.
- You want Spring to auto-detect it using component scanning.
- The object has simple construction logic.
Example: Services, Repositories, Controllers, Utility classes.

Use @Bean when:
- The class is from a third-party library and you cannot annotate it.
- You need custom initialization logic during object creation.
- You want complete control over the bean creation lifecycle.
Example: ObjectMapper, RestTemplate, ModelMapper, custom ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.

Short Rule:
- If you can annotate the class → use @Component.
- If you must create object manually → use @Bean.

===============================================================================

@Configuration
public class UtilityConfig {

    @Bean
    public ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        mapper.findAndRegisterModules();
        return mapper;
    }
}
