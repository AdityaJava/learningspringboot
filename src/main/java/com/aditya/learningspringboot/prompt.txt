Give theory for above and follow instructions also give theory in code window easy to copy. Go indepth

Cascade types
1. Explain All like ALL, PERSIST, MERGE etc
2. Does child entities always get loaded with parent entity? Explain Eager and Lazy loading then and also for whom it is default behaviour
3. Also explain in detail that when we do lazy loading for onetoone mapping suppose and then call the get API it will produce error but will not
   in POST call explain this in detail and to resolve we do @JsonIgnore this will remove it from lazy or eager and another way is to  use
   DTO(Data Transfer Object) and remove

OnetoOne
A. OneToOne unidirectional.
  - Parent to child.
  - Give theory and example with User and Address.
  - User Table has the foreign key of user_address table
  - Also explain with and without @JoinColumn and referencedColumnName
  - How to do when address table have composite primary key
  -

b. OneToOne Bidirectional
  - Parent to child and child to Parent
  - Table structure doesn't change
  - Only the reference is there in object
  - Give example with mappedBy for user and address
  - Give the problem that it will go in recursion when we do get query we can use @JsonManagedReference and @JsonBackReference give example.
  - Mention @JsonManagedReference should be used on owning entity this tells jackson to go ahead and serialize the child entity.
  - Mention @JsonBackReference  should be used with inverse/Child entity and tells jackson to not serialize the parent entity. but we will loose parent entity in
    child
  - But if we want to serialize parent in child entity without recursion we need @JsonIdentityInfo on both child and parent. Give example
    @JsonIdentityInfo(
    generator = ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class,
    property = "id"
    )
