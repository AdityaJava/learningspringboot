Give notes about spring AOP. give in one code window and well indentation and well exampled and
Take one example and give

A. For execution pointcut
1. What is PointCut?
2. execution( public String com.fullpath.Employee.fetchEmployee( )) where public is not mandatory but other things are mandat and we can use * wildcard for single arg and (..) for zero or multiple args/param confirm
3. How to match any method in that package which has single String type arg
4. Match fetchEmployee method that take any single param.
5. wildcards .. for zero or more items and * for 1 item exactly
6. Example for .. can also be used for package names

B. For within pointcut : Macthes all methods within any class or package
1. Give example of Employee class  with @Before

c. @within: Matches any method in a class which has this annotation
1. Give example

d: @annotation: Macthes any method that is annotated with given annotation.
1. Give example

e: args(String, int): Matches any method with particular arguments (or parameters)
 1. example  args(full.package.name.Employee)

f: @args: Matches method with particular parameters and that parameter class is annotated with particular annotation
1. Give example

g: target: Matches any method on a particular instance or class or interface
  1. Example @Before(target(full.package.name.Employee))


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Combining 2 POintcuts using &&(boolean and) or ||(boolean or)
 -> Give example to match where the method should be in EmployeeController and should be annotated with @RestController
 -> Similarlry give with OR

2. Named pointcuts.
 -> Give example with one method inside aspect with @execution

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advice: It is an action which is taken @Before @After @Around the method execution
-> Advice we give inside the body of method annotated with above annotations
-> Give definitions for @Before @After @Around
-> ProceedingJoinPoint jp for @Around

------------------------------------------
Answer below questions
1. How this interception works?
2. What if we have 1000s of pointcut, so wheneever I invoke a method, does matching happens with 1000s of pointcuts?
3. Give like when app starts
  1. Looks for @Aspect annotation classes
  2. parse the pointcut expression -> Done by PointcutParser.java class
  3. Stored in a efficient data structure or cache after parsing
  4. Look for @Component, @Service @Controller etc.
  5. For each class it check if it is eligible for interception based on pointcut expression -> Done by AbstractAutoProxyCreator.java class
  6. If Yes it creates a proxy using JDK dynamic proxy or CGLIB(Code generation library) proxy
     This proxy class has a code which execute advice before the method, the method execution happens and after than advice if any.
  7. Info:- If our class is already a child of interface then JDK dynamic proxy is used.
            If class is not a child of any interface then CGLIB is used. This creates a subclass of our class.
